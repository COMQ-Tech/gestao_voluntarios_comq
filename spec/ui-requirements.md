# UI Requirements: COMQ Volunteer Management System

## Layout & Navigation

- Responsive design: must work on desktop and mobile
- Main navigation via header (shows user info and logout)
- Home page (Welcome): onboarding, resource links, and branding
- Login page: email/password form, error handling, loading state
- Notes page: list and manage notes (placeholder for future expansion)

## Theming & Styling

- Light and dark mode support (auto-detects system preference)
- Uses TailwindCSS utility classes for all styling
- Consistent use of color, spacing, and typography
- Branding: COMQ logo (light/dark), organization name in header

## Accessibility

- All forms and buttons must be keyboard accessible
- Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements
- Use of semantic HTML elements (header, main, nav, etc.)

## User Flows

- Login: user enters email/password, sees error if invalid, redirected if already logged in
- Logout: user can log out from header
- Navigation: user can access home, notes, and logout

## Future UI Considerations

- Volunteer management dashboard
- Admin-only features and role-based UI
- Mobile-first enhancements
